大一的 Java 文件，抄作业的宝子们可以给我一个 star 吗？😄  
Freshman year Java files. If you're copying homework, how about a star? 😄

>> 有一些可能不太准确，我也会站在现在的视角逐步修改之前的代码。  
>> Some parts might not be 100% accurate — I'll go back and fix them from time to time with my current knowledge.

>> 因为隐私原因删除了 EmailSender.java，保留了 lib 里的 jar 包。  
>> Removed `EmailSender.java` for privacy reasons, but the lib folder with jar files is still here.

⭐ 点点 star 不准白嫖 555！
⭐ Please don't just silently take it! Star this repo if you find it helpful, okay? 555😭  
Let’s have fun and learn together~
